        All right, let's do this one last time. My name is Peter Parker. I was
        bitten by a radioactive spider, and for ten years I've been the one and
        only Spider-Man. I'm pretty sure you know the rest. I saved a bunch of
        people, fell in love, saved the city, and then I saved the city again...
        and again and again and again. And I, uh... I did this.

        We don't really talk about this. Look, I'm a comic book, I'm a cereal,
        did a Christmas album. I have an excellent theme song. And a so-so
        popsicle. I mean, I've looked worse. But after everything, I still love
        being Spider-Man. I mean, who wouldn't? So no matter how many hits I
        take, I always find a way to come back. Because the only thing standing
        between this city and oblivion is me. There's only one Spider-Man. And
        you're looking at him.
